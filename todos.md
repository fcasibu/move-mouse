# TODOs

- [ ] Allow configuration
- [ ] Easing functions https://easings.net/
- [ ] Grid-based (seems to be popular in a lot of similar apps, but don't really like this in my workflow though)
- [ ] Compile to .app
- [ ] Figure out how to make this available in the menu bar (mac for now)
    - Initial research suggests i need to learn objective-c
- [ ] Cross-platform (don't have the option to test cross-platform right now, only mac)
